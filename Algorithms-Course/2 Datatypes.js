// How can I check the type of data ?

// We can do that by using a reserved keyword called as type of

let isHungry = false;
let collegeName = "CICCC";
let days = 7;
let collegeAddress;
let isTired = null;

console.log(typeof isHungry);
console.log(typeof collegeName);
console.log(typeof days);
console.log(typeof collegeAddress);
console.log(typeof isTired); // object



// Why null type of gave an object ?

// Most of the things that are derived in javascript are coming from an object
// For Example - array is also of type object


// null --> Objects --> Array , functions etc
